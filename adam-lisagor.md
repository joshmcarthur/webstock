* Summarize idea/project into a few sentences or paragraphs
* Summarize what we are going to do into same? Maybe?
* Treat projects as characters - need to show respect, thoughtfulness

Much of what he said was from a contractor point of view:

* Feel the burn - getting excited about a product or idea is a good sign
* The treatment - treat ideas with respect, ensure a good handle on everything
* Only work with people who want to work with you - if they need convincing, it's not good
* Manage expectations - be honest about what they can expect for what they are putting in, etc.
* Clients like to think of their products as nicer, sexier versions of themselves? (Disclaimer: was tuned out at start of that point)

> I don't know how to make a viral video. I can't do that."

The Feedback Loop

* Feedback is important - silence means they don't like it, but you need to pull the feedback out of them - you need to get what they don't like, so you can fix it.
* Need strong communicators at both ends
* Speak with one voice (when it's more than 1-1)
* Be open to clients having "great ideas"
