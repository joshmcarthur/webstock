* Fear can be employed (govt., media, marketers etc.)
* Social media - information pipeline, not something we can deal with
* Anxiousness and fear as a way of capturing audience

* radical transparency - i.e. FB's privacy rule changes
* understand our role within the ecosystem
* technologies shaping public life
